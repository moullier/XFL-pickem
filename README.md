# To Do

(3) Settings page with admin functionality
    This could allow for scoring algorithm change (store scores when the admin enters), but probably don't have time (?)
(2) Don't allow duplicate picks -- update the existing ones instead - DONE - should test more
(1) Change scoring algorithm - pull the whole schedule once instead of each individual game -- might mitigate some of the asynch challenges - DONE
(4) Commissioner is stored in group -- add some visual indicator of who they are, and maybe let them add users on the league page? - added visual indicator
Make sure passport is working well -- error messages and actually locking pages that should be locked to logged in users
